## Documentation of Services using Satellite Short Burst Data (SBD)

This is the documentation repository for development of some services that use Short Burst Data (SBD) over the Iridium satellite network.

When services are required beyond the reach of wired and cellular networks then the Iridium satellite network covers the globe when the sky is visible. The Short Burst Data service is analogous to cellular SMS (Short Message Service) messaging. If a service can be reduced to information flow that is a few hundred characters then it can be economically supported with SBD.

Canada is a country with incomplete cellular coverage and applications in the surrounding oceans are also ideal for coverage by satellite networks. This project will implement a small subset of needed services to trial the deployment and usability of these services.
